# The Philosophy Behind Sanandem

## Why This Matters

Medicine should work equally well for everyone, but it doesn't. This isn't an accident—it's the result of systemic data gaps and biases in medical research that have persisted for decades.

## The Data Gap Problem

### Historical Context

Until 1993, women of childbearing age were routinely excluded from clinical drug trials in the United States. The rationale was to protect potential fetuses, but the result was catastrophic: medications were tested almost exclusively on men and then prescribed to everyone.

Even after policies changed, the legacy persists:
- As of 2020, women still make up less than 40% of participants in many clinical trials
- Dosing guidelines are often based on a 70kg "reference man"
- Side effects that predominantly affect women are frequently labeled as "rare" or "atypical"
- Medical textbooks have historically used male bodies as the default

### The Consequences

The impact of these gaps is real and measurable:

1. **Adverse Drug Reactions**: Women are 50-70% more likely to experience adverse drug reactions than men, even when body weight is controlled for

2. **Diagnostic Delays**: Conditions that affect women differently (like heart disease) are often misdiagnosed because symptoms don't match the "male pattern"

3. **Pain Management**: Studies show women's pain is more likely to be dismissed as "emotional" or "psychosomatic"

4. **Drug Withdrawals**: 8 out of 10 prescription drugs withdrawn from the U.S. market between 1997 and 2001 were withdrawn due to side effects that occurred predominantly or exclusively in women

## Beyond Gender: Intersectional Health Disparities

The problem extends beyond sex and gender to include:

### Race and Ethnicity
- Certain medications metabolize differently in different ethnic groups
- Clinical trials have historically overrepresented white participants
- Medical algorithms often contain embedded racial biases

### Age
- Older adults are often excluded from trials despite being the highest consumers of medications
- Pediatric dosing is frequently extrapolated from adult data rather than studied directly

### Socioeconomic Factors
- Access to healthcare affects who can participate in research
- Lower-income populations may experience different medication effects due to nutrition, stress, and comorbidities

## Our Approach: Open Data for Open Science

Sanandem addresses these gaps through:

### 1. Inclusive Data Collection
- **Anyone can contribute**: We collect experiences from all demographics
- **Optional demographic data**: Users can share age, gender, and other relevant information
- **Anonymous submission**: No personal identifiers, ensuring privacy

### 2. Transparent Visualization
- **Pattern recognition**: Interactive tools reveal disparities that might otherwise remain hidden
- **Accessible insights**: Complex data presented in understandable formats
- **Real-time analysis**: See how medication effects vary across populations

### 3. Community Empowerment
- **Citizen science**: Every submission contributes to our collective understanding
- **Shared knowledge**: Everyone benefits from aggregated, anonymized insights
- **Advocacy through data**: Evidence-based arguments for better research practices

## Research Ethics & Responsibility

### What We Are
- A **research platform** for collecting anonymized medication experience data
- A **visualization tool** for exploring patterns in medication effects
- An **advocacy project** promoting equity in medical research
- A **public resource** for researchers studying medication safety

### What We Are NOT
- We are **not medical advice**
- We are **not a replacement for clinical trials**
- We are **not diagnostic tools**
- We are **not recommending or discouraging any medication**

### Our Ethical Commitments

1. **Do No Harm**
   - Prominent disclaimers about not substituting medical advice
   - Clear warnings against self-diagnosis or treatment modification
   - Encouragement to consult healthcare professionals

2. **Privacy First**
   - No collection of personally identifiable information
   - Data anonymization before storage
   - Transparent data usage policies

3. **Open Access**
   - All anonymized data available for legitimate research
   - No paywalls or proprietary restrictions
   - Supporting the open science movement

4. **Scientific Rigor**
   - Acknowledging limitations of crowdsourced data
   - Encouraging validation through formal research
   - Promoting collaboration with academic institutions

## Theoretical Foundations

### Feminist Data Studies

Our work draws on feminist approaches to data and technology:

- **Catherine D'Ignazio and Lauren Klein** (*Data Feminism*): Examining power structures in data science
- **Caroline Criado Perez** (*Invisible Women*): Documenting the pervasive gender data gap
- **Safiya Noble** (*Algorithms of Oppression*): Understanding bias in data systems
- **Ruha Benjamin** (*Race After Technology*): Exploring how technology can reinforce or challenge inequality

### Social Justice in Healthcare

We're informed by critical healthcare scholarship:

- **Dorothy Roberts**: Examining how race is used (and misused) in medicine
- **Maya Dusenbery**: Documenting how women are dismissed in healthcare
- **Jonathan Metzl**: Studying structural competency in medicine
- **Paul Farmer**: Understanding health as a human right

### Participatory Research

Our model aligns with:

- **Community-Based Participatory Research (CBPR)**: Involving communities in research that affects them
- **Patient-Centered Outcomes Research**: Prioritizing outcomes that matter to patients
- **Open Science Movement**: Making research transparent and accessible

## The Path Forward

### Short-term Goals
- Build a robust dataset of anonymized medication experiences
- Develop increasingly sophisticated visualization tools
- Establish partnerships with academic researchers
- Expand language support for global participation

### Long-term Vision
- Influence clinical trial design to be more inclusive
- Provide evidence for policy changes in drug approval processes
- Create a model for participatory health research
- Contribute to closing the data gap in medicine

### How Success Looks
- Researchers cite Sanandem data in studies about medication disparities
- Pharmaceutical companies use insights to design more inclusive trials
- Patients feel empowered to share their experiences
- Healthcare providers gain awareness of diverse medication responses
- Policy makers use evidence from the platform to advocate for change

## Join the Movement

Every submission to Sanandem is an act of solidarity. You're contributing to a growing body of evidence that:
- Diverse bodies deserve diverse research
- Patient experiences matter
- Medical science must serve everyone equally
- Data transparency can drive systemic change

But remember: **Always consult healthcare professionals for medical decisions.** This platform empowers research, not self-treatment.
