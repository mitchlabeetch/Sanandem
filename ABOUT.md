# About Sanandem

## The Name

**Sanandem** combines concepts of health ("sana" from Latin *sanus* meaning healthy) and democratic participation ("dem"). It represents our vision: **democratic health data that serves everyone equally**.

## Our Mission

To advance equality in medicine by:
1. **Illuminating disparities** in how medications affect different populations
2. **Empowering individuals** to contribute their experiences to medical knowledge
3. **Providing researchers** with rich, anonymized datasets
4. **Advocating for change** in how medical research is conducted

## The Context: Gender and Health Disparities

### The Historical Problem

For most of medical history, healthcare research has been conducted with a significant blind spot: **the systematic exclusion and underrepresentation of women and other marginalized groups**.

#### Timeline of Exclusion

**Until 1977**: The FDA recommended excluding women of childbearing potential from early drug trials entirely.

**1977-1993**: While the policy was revised, women remained dramatically underrepresented in clinical research.

**1993**: The NIH Revitalization Act mandated inclusion of women in clinical research, but implementation has been slow and incomplete.

**Today**: Despite policy changes, disparities persist:
- Women still comprise less than 40% of participants in many trials
- Analysis by sex/gender is often not conducted even when both sexes are included
- Research in "women's health" is often limited to reproductive issues

### The Consequences

This exclusion has had serious, measurable impacts:

#### Adverse Drug Reactions
- Women are **1.5-1.7 times more likely** to develop adverse drug reactions than men
- **80% of drugs withdrawn** from the market between 1997-2001 posed greater health risks to women than men
- Sex differences in drug metabolism are often not accounted for in dosing guidelines

#### Cardiovascular Disease
- Heart disease kills more women than men, yet research has focused on male presentations
- Women's heart attack symptoms are often different and frequently misdiagnosed
- Women are less likely to receive aggressive treatment for heart conditions

#### Pain Management
- Women's pain is more likely to be dismissed as "emotional" or "psychosomatic"
- Women wait longer in emergency rooms for pain medication
- Chronic pain conditions that predominantly affect women are understudied

#### Mental Health
- Women are more likely to be prescribed psychotropic medications
- Yet medication trials often exclude women or don't analyze sex differences
- Hormonal influences on medication effectiveness are rarely studied

## Beyond Gender: Intersectional Disparities

The problem isn't limited to gender. Medical research suffers from multiple, intersecting biases:

### Race and Ethnicity
- **Clinical trial participation**: Black Americans make up 13% of the U.S. population but only 5% of clinical trial participants
- **Genetic assumptions**: Many medical algorithms incorrectly assume racial categories are genetic rather than social
- **Historical trauma**: The Tuskegee experiment and other abuses have created justified distrust of medical research

### Age
- **Older adults**: Often excluded from trials despite being the largest consumers of medications
- **Children**: Pediatric doses frequently extrapolated from adult data rather than studied
- **Adolescents**: Hormonal changes during puberty rarely accounted for

### Economic Status
- **Access barriers**: Lower-income populations underrepresented in research
- **Comorbidities**: Poverty-related health conditions often excluded from trials
- **Environmental factors**: Stress, nutrition, and housing affect medication response

### LGBTQ+ Communities
- **Data gaps**: Gender-diverse and sexual minority populations rarely studied
- **Hormone interactions**: Transgender individuals on hormone therapy have unique medication considerations
- **Discrimination**: Healthcare bias affects reporting and treatment

## The Feminist Framework

Sanandem is grounded in feminist scholarship that challenges data gaps and power structures:

### Key Concepts

**1. The Gender Data Gap** (Caroline Criado Perez)
- Systematic lack of sex-disaggregated data
- Default male as the norm
- Invisible women in datasets

**2. Data Feminism** (Catherine D'Ignazio & Lauren Klein)
- Examine power in data
- Challenge binary thinking
- Elevate emotion and embodiment
- Make labor visible

**3. Reproductive Justice Framework**
- Right to have children
- Right not to have children
- Right to parent in safe environments
- **Right to bodily autonomy and health**

**4. Intersectionality** (Kimberlé Crenshaw)
- Multiple, overlapping identities
- Compounding disadvantages
- Need for intersectional analysis

### Feminist Principles in Practice

**Centering Marginalized Voices**
- Platform designed to capture diverse experiences
- No gatekeeping of who can contribute
- Anonymous submission protects vulnerable participants

**Challenging Medical Authority**
- Patients as experts in their own experiences
- Lived experience as valid data
- Democratizing medical knowledge

**Collective Action**
- Individual submissions contribute to collective knowledge
- Solidarity through data sharing
- Power in aggregated voices

**Transparency and Accountability**
- Open-source code
- Public data (anonymized)
- Clear about limitations and biases

## The Vision for Change

### What We're Building Toward

**1. Research Transformation**
- Inclusive trial design becomes standard
- Sex/gender analysis required in all studies
- Intersectional data collection normalized

**2. Clinical Practice Evolution**
- Providers aware of diverse medication responses
- Personalized medicine that actually personalizes
- Patient experiences valued in treatment decisions

**3. Policy Impact**
- Evidence-based advocacy for regulatory changes
- Funding priorities shifted toward inclusive research
- Transparency requirements in pharmaceutical development

**4. Cultural Shift**
- Recognition that "one size fits all" doesn't work
- Appreciation for biological diversity
- Healthcare as a right, not a privilege

### How We Get There

**Individual Level**
- Share experiences (when safe to do so)
- Ask questions about research demographics
- Advocate for yourself in healthcare settings

**Community Level**
- Collective data creates collective power
- Support organizations fighting for health equity
- Educate others about disparities

**Systemic Level**
- Use data to advocate for policy changes
- Pressure pharmaceutical companies for inclusive research
- Support funding for diverse health research

## Why Open Source Matters

We chose to make Sanandem open source because:

**Transparency**: Anyone can audit our methods and code

**Accessibility**: No financial barriers to access

**Collaboration**: Researchers worldwide can contribute and improve

**Sustainability**: Community ownership ensures longevity

**Trust**: Open code builds confidence in data handling

**Empowerment**: Users can fork and adapt for their needs

## Limitations and Honest Conversations

We're committed to transparency about what this platform can and cannot do:

### What We Can Do
✅ Reveal patterns in medication experiences across demographics  
✅ Generate hypotheses for formal research  
✅ Provide evidence of disparities  
✅ Empower patient voices  
✅ Support advocacy efforts  

### What We Cannot Do
❌ Replace clinical trials  
❌ Provide individual medical advice  
❌ Prove causation (correlation ≠ causation)  
❌ Guarantee representative samples  
❌ Substitute for professional medical care  

### Ongoing Challenges

**Selection Bias**: People with strong experiences more likely to report

**Verification**: Self-reported data not medically confirmed

**Confounders**: Many factors affect medication responses

**Representation**: May not capture all populations equally

**Misuse Risk**: Data could be misinterpreted or misused

We address these through:
- Clear documentation of limitations
- Statistical methods that account for bias
- Prominent disclaimers
- Collaboration with researchers
- Community oversight

## Join the Movement

Every person who submits data, every researcher who uses the platform, every developer who contributes code, and every advocate who shares our mission is part of building a more equitable healthcare system.

This is bigger than a website. It's about:
- **Justice**: Healthcare that works for everyone
- **Equity**: Research that represents everyone
- **Empowerment**: Patients as partners in knowledge creation
- **Solidarity**: Collective action for systemic change

## Looking Forward

The future we're working toward:
- Medical research that includes everyone by default
- Treatments optimized for diverse bodies
- Healthcare providers trained in health disparities
- Patients empowered with knowledge
- Science that serves all of humanity

**But remember**: While we work toward systemic change, always consult healthcare professionals for individual medical decisions. Sanandem is a research tool, not medical advice.
